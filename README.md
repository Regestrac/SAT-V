# SAT-V
Arduino code for 'Submergible Any Terrain Vehicle'

SAT-V is our Final year project.

We have used aurdino for building the demo model for it. The code for it is available here.


further description:

It is a kind of ATV that can travel through any kind of terrains including underwater.
SAT-V has a Night Vision IP camera for survillence even on night and dark places. It can be controlled Remotely with a receiver.
We have designed its structure in a way that can help it to travel through rough terrains and even underwater.
There is a pumping mechanism that help it sink and refloat to surface which heps in smooth movement through water bodies. 
It has a chained track that help it to move through any kind of surfaces like mud, snow, rocks and other rough areas.
It has several other features like Live recording and transmission of video footage over large distances.
Its body is designed in such a way that it can bear heavy shocks that may occur when travelling through rough terrains.
